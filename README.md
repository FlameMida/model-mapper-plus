# CPA Model Mapper Plus Plugin

`model-mapper-plus` is a CLIProxyAPI (CPA) native plugin. It maps text-generation request model names before CPA selects the upstream execution path, then restores supported response model fields back to the client-requested model only when a mapping matched or a case operation executed and the final model differs from the original.

When CPA invokes the plugin executor callbacks, the same mapping applies across non-streaming HTTP responses, SSE streams, and WebSocket-backed CPA streams that arrive as raw JSON chunks through the existing stream bridge.

The plugin registers `management.register`/`management.handle`: a resource route serves the embedded admin UI (unauthenticated static page), and data routes under `/v0/management/plugins/model-mapper-plus/` manage rules, key bindings, and dry-run previews after CPA-side management authentication.

## Configuration

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: true
  configs:
    model-mapper-plus:
      enabled: true
      priority: 1
      global_rules: ""
      claude_messages_rules: ""
      codex_responses_rules: ""
      openai_completions_rules: ""
      state_file: ""  # optional, defaults to model-mapper-plus-state.json
```

The plugin's own `enabled` field defaults to `true`. Empty rule fields mean the request is skipped and CPA behaves normally.

## Web admin UI

The plugin serves an admin page at `http://<cpa-host>:<api-port>/v0/resource/plugins/model-mapper-plus/index.html`, signed in with the CPA management key. It has three panels:

- **Rules**: edit the global and per-endpoint ordered rule entries (including `\a`/`\A` case operations).
- **Key bindings**: attach an extra rule set to a specific client API key, chained after the top-level rules for that key's requests.
- **Preview**: dry-run a (key, endpoint, model) triple and inspect the M→M₁→M₂ rewrite steps.

After the first save, rules and key bindings live in `state_file` (default basename `model-mapper-plus-state.json`, resolved to an absolute path against the CPA process working directory; parent dirs are created as needed, mode 0600); from then on the state file is the single source of truth and the YAML rule fields no longer take effect (`enabled` still comes from YAML only). Delete the state file to fall back to YAML configuration. The admin UI follows the CPA panel light/dark theme when embedded.

## Key bindings and thinking-effort control

A key binding runs one more structurally identical rule set on top of the top-level output for requests carrying that client key (endpoint segment wins; the binding's global segment is the fallback). Thinking effort is expressed directly through model-name suffixes, for example `claude-opus-4-5(max)=>claude-opus-4-5(high)` — CPA resolves the suffix and it overrides effort fields in the request body. Note that `*` captures swallow the suffix too (`claude-*` captures `opus-4-5(max)`).

## Rule syntax

Each ruleset is a `;`-separated ordered list of entries. An entry is either a `find=>replace` mapping or an exact standalone case operation: `\a` lowercases ASCII English letters and `\A` uppercases them. Whitespace and quotes are invalid inside the decoded rule value.

- Mappings remain case-sensitive and apply to the complete current model name; later mappings see the value produced by every earlier entry.
- `\a` changes only `A` through `Z` to `a` through `z`; `\A` changes only `a` through `z` to `A` through `Z`. Non-ASCII bytes, digits, punctuation, and separators are unchanged.
- Case operations must be complete standalone entries. They are not additional backslash escapes for `find` or `replace`.
- In `find`, `*` captures zero or more characters, including `/`, and captures are numbered from left to right. Wildcard matching does not backtrack: each capture stops at the first occurrence of the next literal. `$` is literal.
- In `replace`, `$1`, `$2`, and later numbers reuse captures. `*` is literal.
- Characters such as `@`, `/`, `[`, `]`, parentheses, dots, hyphens, and underscores are literal and need no escaping.
- Entries are order-sensitive: the selected ruleset runs left to right exactly once, and later entries see the model produced by earlier entries.
- Put more specific wildcard rules before broader fallback rules.
- In `find`, `\` escapes `*`, `;`, `$`, `\`, or `=>`; escaping `$` is accepted but unnecessary. In `replace`, `\=>` is the only backslash escape. Literal `\`, `;`, and `$` cannot be written directly in a replacement, but captures can carry them into the output.

YAML may single-quote the whole rule value. The outer quotes are removed before rule parsing and preserve backslashes; quote characters inside the decoded value remain invalid:

```yaml
global_rules: '@cf/zai-org/glm-4.7-flash=>glm-4.7-flash;deepseek-v4-pro[1m]=>deepseek-v4-pro'
```

Endpoint-specific rules override `global_rules` and do not stack with it:

- `claude` uses `claude_messages_rules` when non-empty.
- `openai-response` uses `codex_responses_rules` when non-empty.
- `openai` uses `openai_completions_rules` when non-empty.
- Other formats use `global_rules`.

### Examples

Claude-family fallback rules, useful in `claude_messages_rules`:

```text
claude-haiku-*=>gpt-5.4-mini;claude-sonnet-*=>gpt-5.4;claude-*=>gpt-5.5
```

Effects:

- `claude-haiku-4.5` -> `gpt-5.4-mini`
- `claude-sonnet-5` -> `gpt-5.4`
- `claude-opus-4` -> `gpt-5.5`

Compact OpenAI alias removal, useful in `codex_responses_rules` or `openai_completions_rules`:

```text
gpt-*-openai-compact=>gpt-$1
```

Effects:

- `gpt-5.5-openai-compact` -> `gpt-5.5`
- `gpt-5.4-mini-openai-compact` -> `gpt-5.4-mini`

Chained mapping runs in the written order:

```text
deepseek-v4-pro=>deepseek-v4-flash;deepseek-v4-flash=>gpt-5.4-mini
```

Effects:

- `deepseek-v4-pro` -> `gpt-5.4-mini`
- `deepseek-v4-flash` -> `gpt-5.4-mini`

Reversing those rules changes the result because rules do not loop back:

```text
deepseek-v4-flash=>gpt-5.4-mini;deepseek-v4-pro=>deepseek-v4-flash
```

Effects:

- `deepseek-v4-pro` -> `deepseek-v4-flash`
- `deepseek-v4-flash` -> `gpt-5.4-mini`

Ordered ASCII case operations can normalize an incoming alias, feed a case-sensitive mapping, transform its output, and continue mapping:

```text
\a;gpt-*=>deepseek-V3;\A;DEEPSEEK-*=>gpt-5.5;\A
```

For `GPT-X`, the values are processed as:

```text
GPT-X -> gpt-x -> deepseek-V3 -> DEEPSEEK-V3 -> gpt-5.5 -> GPT-5.5
```

Use YAML single quotes so the DSL backslashes are preserved:

```yaml
global_rules: '\a;gpt-*=>deepseek-V3;\A;DEEPSEEK-*=>gpt-5.5;\A'
```

## Common use cases

- Use GPT or other upstream models from Claude-compatible clients, such as Claude Code, without changing the client-requested Claude model names.
- Keep client configuration stable while moving execution to newer, cheaper, or provider-specific model names.
- Expose compact or local aliases to clients, then strip the alias suffix before upstream execution.
- Chain temporary migrations, for example routing an old provider model name through an intermediate alias before its final upstream model.
